# StateMachine

## Documentation

The StateMachine docs are best-used in conjunction with the [demos](../demo) which contains a wide selection of examples of all the main [API](http://statemachine.davestewart.io/html/api) features, as well as real world [examples](http://statemachine.davestewart.io/html/examples) such as forms and components. 

The demos also cover the [StateHelper](http://statemachine.davestewart.io/html/setup) class which is designed to quickly wire the relationships between the StateMachine and a UI, freeing you to get on with building your app / component
