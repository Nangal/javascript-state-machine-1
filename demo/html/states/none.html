        <p>It's possible to start with no visual state, just by assigning a state name which is not reflected in your component.</p>
        <p>In the example above, the first event configuration row is set to start from <code>none</code>. As this state doesn't have any visual counterpart, the component starts in an unresolved state, and only updates once moving from state <code>none</code> to state <code>a</code>.</p>
